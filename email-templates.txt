TEMPLATE 1B: WARM OUTREACH - FOUNDING CLIENT OFFER (First 3 Only)
================================================================================

Subject: Quick pre-bid review (Founding Client slot)

Hey [Name] — I'm rolling out a structured bid review service for steel contractors.

If you've got an active bid, I can do a Founding Client review: you book Tier 1 ($497) and I'll deliver Tier 2 depth for the first three clients so I can tighten the process.

Turnaround: 24–48 hours. Deliverable: PDF report with missing-scope checklist + risk flags.

If you want one of the first slots, reply "FOUNDING" and I'll send the intake link.

TEMPLATE 1: WARM OUTREACH (Standard - Not Founding)
================================================================================

Subject: Quick second-eye on your next bid

[Name],

I've packaged the bid review work I've been doing into a standalone service.

If you've got an active bid where you want expert validation before submission, I'm offering fixed-price reviews with 24-48 hour turnaround.

Last week I caught a missed mezzanine scope on a $280k project for another client. Would have been a $40k hole post-award.

Three tiers:
- Scope Validation - $497 (24-hour turnaround)
- Full Bid QC - $997 (tonnage verification + risk analysis)
- Bid + Scope Doc - $1,497 (complete package ready to submit)

Details: [INSERT LANDING PAGE URL]

Let me know if you've got something coming up. Happy to walk through it.

If you need a second set of eyes on an upcoming bid, here's how it works:
- Upload plans
- I extract scope, verify tonnage, flag conflicts

- Fixed price: $497-$1,497 depending on depth

Link: [INSERT LANDING PAGE URL]

Useful for high-dollar bids or complex projects where you want validation before committing.

Hit me back if you want to run something through.

TEMPLATE 2: COLD OUTREACH (New Prospects)
================================================================================

Subject: Caught a $40k scope gap last week

[Name],

I run bid review for structural steel contractors who want expert eyes on their packages before they hit submit.

Last week I caught a missed mezzanine scope on a $280k bid. Client avoided a $40k hole.

The usual culprits:
- Stairs, railings, embed plates buried in architectural drawings
- Tonnage calculation drift on manual takeoffs
- Plan conflicts between structural and architectural

If you've got an active bid and want validation before you commit, I offer 24-48 hour fixed-price reviews.

Details here: [INSERT LANDING PAGE URL]

Worth a look if you're bidding six-figure jobs where margins are tight.

✓ Scope extraction and validation

Three tiers starting at $497. Full details: [INSERT LANDING PAGE URL]

If you're bidding complex projects where you can't afford to leave money on the table, this is cheap insurance.
